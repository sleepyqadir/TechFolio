  "How did everything start? Being a language-lover, I knew that languages were so powerful that they were building bridges between people of various cultures. Though, I had no idea about programming languages until very recently when I decided to develop my career in this field. After exposing myself to programming languages for a while, I did realize that programming languages were nothing less than human languages in this sense as they make communication between people and computers possible. That was when I made my mind up to make a career in tech. Linguaphile turned programmer :) "
